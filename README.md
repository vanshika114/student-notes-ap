## 🌟 What is NSOC'26?

NSOC'26 has been transformed into a **20 Days • 20 Projects Challenge** to provide a smoother and more organized contribution experience.

Sorry for the inconvenience. The previous **Student Notes App** project was frequently running into large merge conflicts due to the high number of PRs. Because of that, I've changed it to **20 Days, 20 Projects**.

Drop your crazy frontend projects, UI designs, landing pages, components, dashboards, animations, and anything else you've built. Let's create and showcase as many projects as possible!

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top-right corner.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/student-notes-app.git
```

### 3. Create a New Project Folder

Example:

```text
student-notes-app/
│
├── calculator/
├── weather-app/
├── study-timer/
└── your-project/
```

### 4. Add Your Files

```text
your-project/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
```

### 5. Link your Project to the Main Dashboard

Open the root `index.html` file, locate the `<div class="card-container">` section, and add a new HTML card block that hyperlinks to your newly created folder.

### 6. Commit and Create a Pull Request

Push your changes and open a PR.

### ⚠️ Crucial: Linking Your Project to the Main Grid
To prevent severe Git merge conflicts, **DO NOT modify `index.html` directly!** As multiple contributors submit projects simultaneously, directly editing the main HTML file will cause your Pull Request to conflict and fail. 
* **To add your project to the main showcase:** Please add a new entry to the `projects.json` file (or follow the repository's designated safe-linking process). 

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Each contributor should create a separate folder.

Example:

```text
/project-name
│
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
```

### Important

* Keep all files inside your project folder.
* Do not modify other contributors' projects.
* Use meaningful folder names.
* Keep pull requests focused on a single project or improvement.

## 📜 Contribution Guidelines

### 📁 Where to Put Your Project
To keep this repository organized, **all new projects must be placed in their own dedicated folder at the ROOT level of the repository.** **❌ DO NOT:**
* Do not place your project inside  other existing project's folder.
* Do not place your files loosely in the root directory without a containing folder.

**✅ DO:**
* Create a new folder at the root level named after your project (e.g., `student-notes-app/my-awesome-game/`).
* Place all your HTML, CSS, and JS files strictly inside that new folder.

Before submitting a PR:

* Create a dedicated folder for your project.
* Follow clean folder naming conventions.
* Avoid unnecessary dependency additions.
* Do not overwrite existing work.
* Test your project before submission.
* Keep pull requests small and focused.

### 🎨 Centralized Theme Management
To maintain a consistent UI/UX across all projects, **do not write custom dark mode toggles**. Instead, link the global theme files in your project's `index.html`:
1. Add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="../global-theme.css">` inside your `<head>`.
2. Add `<script src="../global-theme.js"></script>` before the closing `</body>` tag.
3. Use the CSS variables (`var(--bg-color)`, `var(--text-color)`, etc.) in your local CSS files instead of hardcoding colors.
