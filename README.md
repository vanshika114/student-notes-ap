## 🌟 What is NSOC'26?

NSOC'26 has been transformed into a **20 Days • 20 Projects Challenge** to provide a smoother and more organized contribution experience.

Instead of contributing to one large codebase with frequent merge conflicts, contributors can now create and maintain their own independent projects inside dedicated folders.

This approach makes contributing easier, especially for beginners.

## Responsive Design & Testing Guidelines

To ensure all applications provide a consistent user experience across devices, contributors must adhere to the following mobile-first design and testing guidelines:

### Minimum Supported Screen Sizes
* **Mobile:** 320px (e.g., iPhone SE, small Android devices)
* **Tablet:** 768px
* **Desktop:** 1024px and above

### Mobile Viewport Testing Requirements
* Ensure the `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` tag is present in the `<head>` of all HTML files.
* Test UI components using Chrome DevTools (Device Mode) or Firefox Responsive Design Mode before submitting a PR.
* Verify that no horizontal scrolling occurs on mobile viewports (overflow-x hidden where necessary).

### Touch Interaction Guidelines
* **Touch Targets:** Buttons and interactive elements should have a minimum touch target size of 44x44 pixels.
* **Hover States:** Do not rely solely on `:hover` states for critical interactions, as they do not translate to touch screens. Provide visible UI buttons or tap alternatives.

### Browser Compatibility Matrix
| Browser | Minimum Version | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Google Chrome | Latest 2 versions | Primary testing target |
| Mozilla Firefox | Latest 2 versions | |
| Safari (iOS/Mac) | Latest 2 versions | Test touch interactions thoroughly |
| Microsoft Edge | Latest 2 versions | |
