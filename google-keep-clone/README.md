## 💾 State Management & Data Storage

This project operates entirely on the client side, utilizing the browser's **Web Storage API (`localStorage`)** to manage state and persistent user data. No external servers or API backends are required to run the project.

Data is stored under the following registry keys:

* **`sna_notes`**: Stores all created notes, including titles, contents, checklist objects, pinned status, archive/trash flags, and color palette states as a JSON array.
* **`sna_labels`**: Holds custom categories created in the sidebar dynamically.
* **`sna_users`**: Manages all registered user accounts. Passwords are encrypted using a custom hashing algorithm (`_simpleHash()`) for local security before being saved.
* **`sna_session`**: Holds the active logged-in user profile metadata and session timestamps.
* **`weeklySelfTestResults`**: Tracks MCQ scores, attempted counts, correct counts, and timestamps for performance dashboard visualizations.
* **`sna_theme`**: Saves active light or dark theme values permanently.

## 🚀 Setting Up the Project Locally

Since this is a client-side web application built using standard HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript, there are **no external dependencies or database installation steps** required! All you need is:
1. A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari).
2. A code editor (like VS Code).

### Run Locally in VS Code (Recommended)
1. Install the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Click the **Go Live** button at the bottom right corner of your VS Code status bar.
4. Your browser will automatically open the project dashboard locally (usually at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`).

### Run by Opening HTML Files Directly
1. Navigate to the project folder in your file explorer.
2. Double-click on `index.html` to open it in your default web browser.
3. For authentication features, open `auth.html` directly in the browser.
